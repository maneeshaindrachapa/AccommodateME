AccomodateME is an online boarding house searching application which has been designed to help students of University of Moratuwa in finding a suitable accommodating environment.

## Why AccomodateME ?
Because of lack of resources all Students of University of Moratuwa wonâ€™t get hostel facilities. Only few of first years and final year Students get those facilities. Therefore, most of Students have to find a boarding by themselves. As we know it takes a lot of time and effort. In other hand, most of them will not happy with the boarding places they find. So, we are trying to implement a system that gives facility of finding boarding places online according to their preferences. Using that system Students will be able to find proper boarding place and also Boarding Owners will be able to rent their boarding places without any brokers.
